#### Hands-on Practice

**Module 2 — Preparation**

* Create a VPC for the Linux Instance.
* Create a VPC for the Windows Instance.
* Create a Security Group for Linux:
* Allow SSH from a personal IP.
* Allow HTTP if running a web server is needed.


* Create a Security Group for Windows:
* Allow RDP from a personal IP.
* Do not open `0.0.0.0/0` unless necessary.



**Module 3 — Launch Microsoft Windows Server 2022 Instance**

* Select the Microsoft Windows Server 2022 AMI.
* Choose an Instance Type suitable for the Free Tier or lab.
* Assign a Key Pair to retrieve the password.
* Configure the Security Group to allow RDP.
* Launch the Windows EC2 Instance.
* Decrypt the password using the key pair file.
* Connect to the Windows Instance using Remote Desktop.

**Module 4 — Launch Amazon Linux Instance**

* Select the Amazon Linux AMI.
* Choose an appropriate Instance Type.
* Assign a Key Pair.
* Configure the Security Group to allow SSH.
* Launch the Linux EC2 Instance.
* Connect to the instance via SSH using a terminal.

**Module 5 — Amazon EC2 Basic**

* Practice changing the Instance Type.
* Create and manage an EBS Snapshot.
* Create a Custom AMI from a configured EC2 Instance.
* Launch a new EC2 Instance from the Custom AMI.

**Module 9 — Clean up resources**

* Terminate unused EC2 Instances.
* Delete unnecessary EBS Volumes.
* Delete Snapshots if no longer used.
* Delete the AMIs created in the lab.
* Delete Security Groups, VPCs, or supplementary resources if no longer needed.
* Check the Billing Dashboard after cleanup.

#### Challenges and Solutions

**Challenges:**

* Initially, it is easy to confuse VPCs, Subnets, and Security Groups.
* When connecting to a Windows Instance, you need to decrypt the password using the exact key pair.
* When SSH-ing into Linux, errors easily occur due to incorrect `.pem` file permissions.
* If the wrong port or wrong source IP is opened in the Security Group, connection is impossible.
* Certain resources like EBS Snapshots, AMIs, and Elastic IPs may incur charges if you forget to delete them.
* When deploying the app, you may encounter package, firewall, port, or database connection errors.

**Solutions:**

* Double-check the network architecture before launching an instance.
* Name resources clearly following a format:
* `fcj-linux-vpc`
* `fcj-windows-vpc`
* `fcj-linux-sg`
* `fcj-windows-sg`


* Only open SSH/RDP to your personal IP; avoid opening it to the entire Internet.
* For Linux, run the key pair permission command before SSH:

```bash
chmod 400 first-kp.pem

```
