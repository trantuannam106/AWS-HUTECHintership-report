#### Difficulties and Solutions

**Difficulties:**

- Initially confused between networking components such as VPC and Security Groups.
- Remote connection failed when inbound rules were configured incorrectly.
- SSH authentication failed due to incorrect `.pem` file permissions.
- Some AWS resources continued generating charges if not cleaned up.
- Deployment issues occurred because of firewall and database configuration errors.

**Solutions:**

- Reviewed AWS networking concepts before deployment.
- Restricted SSH and RDP access to personal IP only.
- Fixed SSH permission issue using:

```bash
chmod 400 first-kp.pem
