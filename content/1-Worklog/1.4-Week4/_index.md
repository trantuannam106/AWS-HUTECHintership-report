### Week 4 Achievements:

#### Knowledge

**What is Amazon RDS?**

* Grasped that it is a relational database service fully managed by the AWS ecosystem.
* Recognized the convenience of RDS as it allows operating a database without worrying about maintaining physical servers or operating systems.
* It is well-suited for systems with demanding transaction processing (orders, users, payments) or clearly structured data warehouses.
* Learned the list of compatible engines including: Amazon Aurora, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB.

**Managed Service in RDS**

* Understood the nature of a "managed service", freeing users from the burden of server OS administration.
* Routine maintenance tasks such as patching, software updates, backups, scaling, and failover are handled automatically by AWS.
* Saves time so the technical team can focus on optimizing data structures and application development.

**VPC, Subnets, and DB Subnet Group**

* Grasped the concept of a VPC as an isolated virtual network environment to protect AWS resources.
* Differentiated and learned how to deploy two types of subnets: public and private.
* Public subnets are allocated for EC2 instances to communicate with the Internet.
* Private subnets are used to host RDS, hiding the database from public network risks.
* Understood the definition of a DB Subnet Group as a cluster of subnets specifically designated for the RDS system.
* Comprehended the DB Subnet Group design principle: it must span at least 2 Availability Zones for fault tolerance.

**Security Groups for EC2 and RDS**

* Viewed Security Groups as virtual firewalls providing instance-level protection (for both EC2 and RDS).
* For EC2, required to open basic communication ports:
* `22` for SSH
* `80` for HTTP
* `443` for HTTPS
* `5000` for the custom application


* For RDS (e.g., using MySQL/Aurora), required to allow access via port `3306`.
* Applied the principle of least privilege: Do not expose the database port to the Internet; only allow inbound traffic originating from the EC2 instance's Security Group.

**EC2 Instance as an Application Server**

* Mastered the steps to launch an EC2 instance running Amazon Linux.
* Selected the correct image (Amazon Linux 2023 AMI).
* Configured a cost-effective instance type (`t2.micro` or `t3.micro`).
* Managed Key Pairs for secure authentication during connection.
* Used MobaXterm to SSH into the system via Public IP/DNS.

**RDS Database Instance**

* Proficiently provisioned an RDS Database Instance using the Standard create option.
* Learned how to customize parameters: engine type, version, login credentials (master user/pass), and assigned the VPC and Security Group.
* Recognized the state transition process of the database from `Creating` to `Available`.
* Knew how to extract the connection string (Endpoint) and port information to configure the app server.

**Deploying an Application Connected to RDS**

* Learned how to download source code from GitHub to the EC2 server environment.
* Completed the installation of Node.js, the npm package manager, and dependencies (Express, dotenv, MySQL).
* Declared a `.env` environment file to secure sensitive information: Endpoint, database name, username, and password.
* Connected to the newly created database, set up the `first_cloud_users` database, created the `user` table, and inserted test data.
* Started the web app via the `npm start` command and tested its functionality on the browser over port `5000`.

**Backup and Restore in RDS**

* Understood the difference between automated backups and manual snapshots.
* Monitored backups in the Maintenance & backups section on the console.
* Learned how to export a snapshot and use it to stand up a completely new DB Instance.
* Understood that after restoration, the system will assign a different Endpoint, requiring updates to the connection configuration on the application side.

**Resource Cleanup**

* Mastered the procedure to remove the RDS Database Instance, Snapshots, and related DB Subnet Groups.
* Terminated the EC2 virtual machine immediately after finishing the lab.
* Sequentially deleted network components such as Security Groups, NAT Gateways, Elastic IPs, and the VPC.
* Realized the importance of cross-checking the Cost Explorer or Billing Dashboard to ensure no unexpected charges occur due to leftover resources.
