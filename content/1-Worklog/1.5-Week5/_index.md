### Results achieved in week 5:

#### Knowledge

**Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling**

- Understood that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances according to application demand.
- Learned that Auto Scaling improves application availability by replacing unhealthy instances and launching new ones when needed.
- Understood that Auto Scaling can help optimize cost by increasing capacity during high traffic and reducing capacity during low traffic.
- Learned the basic components of an Auto Scaling architecture:
  - Launch Template
  - Auto Scaling Group
  - Minimum Capacity
  - Desired Capacity
  - Maximum Capacity
  - Scaling Policy
  - Health Check

**Application Load Balancer**

- Understood that Application Load Balancer distributes HTTP or HTTPS traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
- Learned that the Load Balancer helps prevent a single instance from becoming overloaded.
- Understood that Load Balancer improves fault tolerance by routing traffic only to healthy targets.
- Learned the relationship between Load Balancer, Listener, Target Group, and EC2 instances.
- Understood how the Load Balancer DNS name can be used to access the deployed application.

**Target Group**

- Understood that a Target Group is used to register EC2 instances that receive traffic from the Load Balancer.
- Learned how to configure the Target Group protocol and port for the FCJ Management application.
- Understood that the health check path and port are important for determining whether an instance is healthy.
- Learned that Auto Scaling Group can automatically register and deregister EC2 instances with the Target Group.

**Launch Template**

- Understood that a Launch Template stores configuration information used to launch EC2 instances automatically.
- Learned that a Launch Template may include AMI ID, Instance Type, Key Pair, Security Group, and other EC2 configuration settings.
- Understood that Auto Scaling Group uses the Launch Template to create new EC2 instances with the same environment.
- Learned that creating an AMI from a pre-configured EC2 instance helps simplify the deployment of identical application servers.

**Amazon Machine Image**

- Understood that an AMI is a snapshot-like image used to create EC2 instances with pre-installed software and configuration.
- Learned that the configured FCJ Management EC2 instance can be converted into an AMI.
- Understood that this AMI can be reused by the Launch Template to automatically create new application servers.

**Scaling Solutions**

- Understood the differences between multiple scaling methods:
  - Manual Scaling
  - Scheduled Scaling
  - Dynamic Scaling
  - Predictive Scaling
- Manual Scaling is used when the administrator directly changes the desired capacity.
- Scheduled Scaling is used when capacity changes are planned for a specific time.
- Dynamic Scaling is used when capacity changes depend on metrics such as request count or CPU utilization.
- Predictive Scaling uses historical metrics to forecast future traffic and prepare capacity in advance.

**CloudWatch Metrics**

- Understood that CloudWatch is used to collect and monitor AWS resource metrics.
- Learned how scaling policies depend on CloudWatch metrics to make scaling decisions.
- Understood that Predictive Scaling requires enough metric data to generate forecast charts.
- Learned how to read graphs related to load, capacity, and scaling behavior.

### Difficulties encountered in week 5:

- The Auto Scaling architecture included many components, so it was necessary to understand the relationship between Launch Template, Target Group, Load Balancer, and Auto Scaling Group.
- It was easy to confuse the Security Group rules for EC2, Load Balancer, and RDS.
- The application could not be accessed if the Target Group port or health check configuration was incorrect.
- The Load Balancer DNS name needed some time before it became available.
- Auto Scaling Group required correct subnet and Target Group configuration to launch and register EC2 instances properly.
- Predictive Scaling was more difficult to understand because it depends on CloudWatch metric data and forecasting charts.
- Resource cleanup required careful checking because some resources could not be deleted while still attached to other services.

---

### Solutions and lessons learned:

- Checked each AWS component step by step instead of configuring everything at once.
- Verified Security Group inbound rules whenever the application could not be accessed.
- Checked Target Group health status to identify whether EC2 instances were ready to receive traffic.
- Used the Load Balancer DNS name instead of accessing a single EC2 Public IP.
- Checked Auto Scaling activity history to understand why an instance was launched or terminated.
- Used CloudWatch metrics to observe traffic, capacity, and scaling behavior.
- Cleaned resources in the correct order: Auto Scaling Group, Load Balancer, Target Group, Launch Template, AMI, EC2, RDS, Security Groups, and VPC.
